# Various interpeters
This repository contains the list of interpreters created during the Translation of Programming Languages course at the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade.

This repository contains the following colection of interpreters:
- assembly generator
- finite_automata - it's not actually a intepreter, but that's a concept alse presented throughout the course;
- graph_operations
- matrix
- polynomials

Here are some of the commands we would like to process and execute:
  '''
<1, -3, 0, -1, 6>
<1, 2, 1, 2> + <0, -1, 3>
<1, 2, 1, 2> - <0, -1, 3>
<1, 2, 1, 2> * <0, -1, 3>
- <0, -1, 3>
p1 := <1, 2, 1, 2>
p2 := <0, -1, 3>
p1 * p2
p3 := (p1-p2)*<1>
p3
p1 == <1,2,3>
p1 != p2

//p1'
(p1+p2)'- <1, 1>'
//$p1|3
//$p1+p2|2.3
//<1, 2> + $p1+p2|2.3
//p1[1]
//(p1+p2)[0]
  '''
- set_operations
- stacks_n_queues
